TweetGuard is a web-based application that detects hate speech in tweets using a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The model is trained to classify tweets as either Hate Speech or Not Hate Speech and is deployed using a simple Flask interface, accessible through a browser.

This project demonstrates how transformer-based NLP models can be used for toxic content moderation and real-time classification tasks on social media content.
